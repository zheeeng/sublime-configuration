This is the `User` folder of my Sublime Text 3.

## Usage

1. Remove the `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User` folder to Trash Bin.
2. Clone the repository into `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/` with renaming it as `User`:

        $: git clone https://github.com/zheeeng/sublime-configuration User

3. Install [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) and run `Package Control: Upgrade/Overwrite Package` in Command Palette(⌘ + ⇧ + P).
